**This repository is dedicated to a series of hands-on projects designed for the purpose of learning AWS. The projects are hosted on the following website: https://dev.d3ny68oq0ms5dc.amplifyapp.com/**

**Project Details**
The hands-on projects featured on the LearnAWS website serve as practical demonstrations of AWS services in action. These projects are designed to provide valuable learning experiences for those interested in gaining proficiency with AWS. By exploring these projects, you can gain insights into various aspects of AWS development, including web hosting, serverless computing, API management, and NoSQL database usage.

**Technologies Used:-**
The projects have been built using a combination of AWS services to demonstrate practical applications. The key AWS services employed in these projects include:

**AWS Amplify:** Amplify is used for web hosting and continuous deployment, enabling efficient development and deployment of web applications.

**AWS Lambda:** AWS Lambda functions provide serverless compute power to execute code in response to various events, making the projects highly scalable and cost-effective.

**AWS API Gateway:** API Gateway is used to create, publish, and manage RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the projects.

**DynamoDB:** DynamoDB is employed as the database service, offering a highly scalable and flexible NoSQL database solution for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
